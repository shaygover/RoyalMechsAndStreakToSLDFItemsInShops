## Required Mods:
- ModTek v0.7.7.2 or later: https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek

## Note
Streak Missile Launchers and RoyalMechs require Heavy Metal DLC.
Maybe CustomAmmoCategories implementation (Part of https://github.com/BattletechModders/CustomBundle) can bypass this requirement but I didn't try. Should you succeed, please open a detailed issue.
